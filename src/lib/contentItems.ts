The concentric circles are bubbles expelled by the star over time. The dust cloud resembles a translucent pastry pulled to golden yellow points near our upper right and lower left, with a blob of bright purple jelly inside the bulbous pale blue core. The jelly-like center represents X-ray data from Chandra. The outer cloud and translucent circles represent visible light data from the Hubble Space Telescope.",

Thin white lines layered onto the top panel frame the area being highlighted, and indicate that the perspective in the bottom panel has been rotated approximately 45 degrees to our right. In the bottom panel, dappled orange mist overlaps with cloudy indigo veins, and light purple specks. These patches of veiny mist are molecular clouds. By combining data from IXPE and Chandra, researchers have determined that the X-ray light in the clouds originated from Sagittarius A* during an outburst approximately 200 years ago.",

      "The composite image includes data from both X-ray and Optical light. It features the entirety of the M51 galaxy, which indeed resembles a swirling whirlpool in a black sea, viewed from above. At the core of the cloudy blue whirlpool is a bright white light from which wispy spiraling arms appear to swirl. The swirling arms are the color of red wine and resemble long tendrils of smoke. Along the lengths of the spiraling arms are specks of light in white and neon purple. One of the spiraling arms curves up toward our upper left. There, it appears to dissipate in a pool of pale purple light. Overlaid on one of the spiraling arms, to our right of the bright white core, is a box rendered in thin white lines. Inside this box is a speck of white light. Here, astronomers have detected the first evidence of a possible planet passing in front of a star outside of our Milky Way. In this small spot in the M51 galaxy, Astronomers and researchers have detected a dimming of X-rays from a system where a large star is in orbit around a small, dense neutron star or black hole. The dimming is interpreted as being a planet passing in front of the bright, dense object. For this release, that interpretation has been illustrated by an artist.",

      "This image of Cassiopeia A resembles a disk of electric light with red clouds, glowing white streaks, red and orange flames, and an area near the center of the remnant resembling a somewhat circular region of green lightning. X-rays from Chandra are blue and reveal hot gas, mostly from supernova debris from the destroyed star, and include elements like silicon and iron. X-rays are also present as thin arcs in the outer regions of the remnant. Infrared data from Webb is red, green, and blue. Webb highlights infrared emission from dust that is warmed up because it is embedded in the hot gas seen by Chandra, and from much cooler supernova debris. Hubble data shows a multitude of stars that permeate the field of view.",
